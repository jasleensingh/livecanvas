LiveCanvas is an application for creating stylized 2D animations. It supports both interpolation (tweened) and key-frame based animation, or any mixture of the two. Objects in a scene to be animated are represented as an hierarchy of triangle meshes, each of which has additional information about color and tone. A generator then distributes particles on the surface of each mesh. An object is animated by deforming its component meshes, with the particles maintaining their relative position with respect to the vertices. A renderer then draws the output image given the position of the particles. Since objects are represented as meshes, and the application automatically does color blending between two key-frames, we can also use it to create animated morphs rendered in non-photorealistic styles. The generated frames maintain temporal coherency of the brush strokes thus avoiding the shower door effect and results in smooth-looking animations.
